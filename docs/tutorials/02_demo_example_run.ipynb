    "The class constructor for `PopEstimator` can take population data as an argument. If we want to use the same population data for all the calculations we're doing with an instance of `PopEstimator`, we can give it population data when we instantiate. If we wanted to use different population data, we could pass those data directly to `est_exposed_pop` and `est_total_pop`. In our case, we'll be using the same population data, so we'll give it to the `PopEstimator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to get estimates by administrative unit, like ZCTAs, we'd give it that data too. But right now, we don't want that, so all we need is population data. \n",
    "\n",
    "After we make an estimator, we can call the method `est_exposed_pop` to actually get the estimate of the number of people exposed. \n",
    "\n",
    "To indicate to `est_exposed_pop` that we want to find the number of people living near one or more disasters, rather than the number of people near each unique disaster, we'll use the `hazard_specific` parameter. When we set `hazard_specific` to `False`, this tells `est_exposed_pop` that we want to one estimate of everyone exposed to one or more disaster, rather than estimates of the number of people exposed to every unique disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're looping over three years, we'll initialize an empty list first, and then store the results in this list. We're also adding a year variable to the result as we go. In total, this takes around 5 seconds.\n"
