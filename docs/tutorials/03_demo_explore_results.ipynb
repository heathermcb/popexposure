If we assume that the population of interest (ex. children under 5) is uniformly distributed throughout the residential population, we can take the function output describing the proportion of the population residing within 10km of the fire boundaries and multiply this by the under 5 population to estimate the number of children exposed. This is improves upon the strategy of using census data and hazard boundaries to find the exposed populuation, which assumes that the population is uniformly distributed across space. We could do this for any census-described population. "
